# mern-Project-server

THis is my first complete backend REST API. IT features all the important security features such as: Authentication, encryption, Authorization, and token exchanges.
it also utilizes a Database(mongo db) complete with an ORM(mongoose). MVC structure: Models, controllers, and routes for the view which is a REACT app. and Full CRUD
functionality.

The code is easy to maintain and is very scalable. I might plan to use this code for other REST APIs and a similar methodology for GraphQL as well as potential 
microservice architures. But that is for other projects.

Being that all I want to showcase is the basics of REST APIs, I kept the react appp very minimal. Please see project_oog_2, or got to ooglandish.web.app to see my
fully featured react app.

run this project: 

1. pull this repo and mern_Project found here: https://github.com/Cerezze/mern-Project. The server and the client respectively.

2. Make sure you have the latest nodejs version, You can download nodejs from nodejs.com.

3. download mongodb atlus at mongodb.com.

4. open my server app inside a code editor of your choice. I have specified locations of where to add the mongoURI /*ADD MONGO URI HERE INSIDE THE SINGLE QUOTES*/
So you will need to create your own mongodb account and add your URI in app.js at the bottom inside the single quotes.

5. then you can open the client side app and run it in the terminal type: npm start. 

6. to run your serverside app, run nodemon app.js or node app.js

Please contact me via email: gm.c.burzo@gmail.com if you need help putting this together, I will be more than happy to talk you through the process.
